# Using Math in Your Blog Posts

DevBlog comes with built-in support for mathematical expressions using [KaTeX](https://katex.org/). This allows you to include complex equations and mathematical notation directly in your Markdown content.

## Inline Math

You can include inline math expressions by wrapping them in single dollar signs `$...$` or `\(...\)`. For example:

- The famous Einstein equation $E = mc^2$ shows the relationship between energy and mass.
- The Pythagorean theorem states that \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\) for right triangles.

## Display Math

For standalone equations, use double dollar signs `$$...$$` or `\[...\]`:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}(e^x) = e^x
$$

Or the equivalent using the alternative syntax:

\[
\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)
\]

## More Complex Examples

### Matrices

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x \\
y
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
ax + by \\
cx + dy
\end{pmatrix}
$$

### Summations

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$

### Limits

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x} = 1
$$

### Fractions and Binomials

$$
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
$$

## Conclusion

Using math in your blog posts is straightforward with DevBlog theme. Just wrap your LaTeX expressions in the appropriate delimiters, and they'll be beautifully rendered on your page.
